    <li>RUN IN TERMINAL: docker-compose --build </li>
</ol>

How to connect to the database:
1. EXECUTE IN TERMINAL: docker exec -it marketplace-postgres-1 psql -U myuser -d mydatabase 
2. EXECUTE: \c mydatabase
3. EXECUTE: \d to see the relations
4: QUERYING: e. g. SELECT * FROM users; (note ; at the end is important)
